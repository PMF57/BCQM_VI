# RUN_REPORT — Ablation suite W=100 (nospace vs space-on vs glue-off)

## Purpose
Bulletproof the Path A claim by adding a **space-on + glue-off** ablation.
We compare three conditions for N=4 and N=8 at W=100 with n∈{0,0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8} and 8 seeds:
- **nospace**: space layer disabled (baseline; confirms n does not leak into v_glue)
- **space-on**: space layer enabled with p_reuse := n (Path A scan)
- **glue-off**: space layer enabled, but glue coherence disabled (phase/cadence couplings off; hop noise high)

## Key outcomes
- **nospace**: S_perc=S_junc_w=0 for all n; Q_clock constant across n ⇒ scan parameter does not affect clock engine when space is disabled.
- **glue-off**: S_perc and S_junc_w still rise with n (space percolates), but Q_clock collapses to O(10^-2) ⇒ space can emerge without a good clock; clock requires glue.
- **space-on**: reproduces two-step emergence (percolation first, islands later) with N-dependent threshold sensitivity.
