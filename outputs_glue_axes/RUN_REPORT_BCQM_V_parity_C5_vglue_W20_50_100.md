# RUN_REPORT — BCQM V parity regression (C5 phase+cadence) via v_glue engine

## Purpose
Confirm that **bcqm_vi_spacetime** (v_glue engine) behaves as a **direct code descendant** of BCQM V glue-axis code by replaying the BCQM V C5 (phase+cadence) configuration and reproducing qualitative behaviour across (W_coh, N) sweeps.
This report records the first parity slices at W=20,50,100 using 16–18 seeds.

## Method
- Engine: `engine.mode = v_glue` (ported BCQM V state + kernels + metrics)
- Config provenance: parameters taken from `provenance.v_config` (original BCQM V YAML)
- Summary tool: `analysis/sweetspot_check.py` (v0.2 robust stats: mean, std, median, IQR, 10% trimmed mean)

## Results
### W_coh = 20

### W_coh = 100

| N | count | Q_clock mean±std | median [Q1,Q3] | trim10 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 2 | 0.157±0.019 | 0.157 [0.147,0.167] | 0.157 |
| 2 | 2 | 0.752±0.13 | 0.752 [0.685,0.818] | 0.752 |
| 4 | 18 | 0.988±0.22 | 0.973 [0.88,1.08] | 1.01 |
| 8 | 18 | 1.12±0.8 | 0.773 [0.585,1.5] | 1.04 |

- Sweet-spot heuristic (mean): **FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE**
- Sweet-spot heuristic (median): **PASS**

## Interpretation
- **W-dependent behaviour is clear.** The same C5 phase+cadence mechanism does not produce a single universal sweet spot across all W.
- **Heavy-tailed behaviour at W=100 for N=8:** mean Q_clock for N=8 exceeds N=4, but median shows N=4 typically better. This indicates rare high-lock episodes at larger N that inflate the mean.
- **At W=50:** both mean and median indicate N=8 slightly better than N=4 in raw Q_clock; no N≈4 sweet spot by these criteria.
- **At W=20:** median indicates a local maximum around N≈4 vs N=8 (PASS on median heuristic), while mean is near-tied between N=4 and N=8.
- Conclusion: parity regression is **consistent with BCQM V's qualitative narrative** once one distinguishes typical behaviour (median) from rare episodes (mean), and accepts W-dependence.

## Next step
Proceed to one of:
1) repeat parity slice for C9 (phase+cadence+domains) to confirm domains remain a spectator axis, or
2) reintroduce VI-only cross-links and return to the coupled L–S transition programme now that L is generated by the authentic IV/V glue mechanism.
